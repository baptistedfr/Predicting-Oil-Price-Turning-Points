    Particle Swarm Optimisation for optimizing LPPL parameters.

    Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. 
    The algorithm involves a group of particles, each representing a set of parameters of the model, which collectively explore 
    the search space to find the optimal solution (minimum RSS).  These particles move through the space by adjusting their positions and velocities based 
    on two primary influences: the best solution they have individually found and the best solution discovered by the entire group. 
    Over successive iterations, particles communicate and learn from each other, progressively converging towards the optimal region of the search space.
