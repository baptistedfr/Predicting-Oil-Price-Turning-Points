    Firefly Optimisation for optimizing LPPL parameters.

    The Firefly Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of fireflies. 
    It uses the concept of attraction based on brightness and global communication among particles to solve optimization problems 
    effectively.
    It is based on the swarm behavior like fish, insects, and bird training in nature. 
    Firefly algorithm has a lot of similarities with SI algorithms like PSO, Artificial Bee Colony optimization, and Bacterial Foraging algorithms. 
    Firefly algorithm uses real random numbers. It is based on the global communication among the swarming particles (i.e., the fireflies). It appears to be more effective in multiobjective optimization. 
    The firefly algorithm has three rules which are based on flashing characteristics of real fireflies. These are as follows:
    1. All fireflies are unisex, and they will move toward more attractive and brighter ones regardless their sex.
    2. The degree of attraction of a firefly is proportional to its brightness which cuts as the distance from the other firefly 
    increases due to the fact that the air absorbs light. If there is not a brighter or more attractive firefly than a particular one, 
    it will then move randomly.
    3. The brightness or light intensity of a firefly is determined by the value of the objective function of a given problem.
